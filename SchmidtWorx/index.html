        Systems, stewardship, and the quiet work of building things that last.

    <section>
      <h2>What This Is</h2>
      <p>
        SchmidtWorx is a personal workspace.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a place to think in public just enough to be useful, to document systems that work,
        and to preserve ideas that deserve more than a forgotten notebook or an old hard drive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of what lives here is technical.  Some of it is reflective.  All of it is intentional.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Systems</h2>
      <p>
        I build and manage systems for a living, but more importantly, I try to understand how
        systems behave over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        That includes technology, organizations, processes, and personal habits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is not complexity.  The goal is durability, clarity, and the ability to adapt
        without thrashing.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>
        Projects here range from practical to experimental.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some are finished.  Some are in progress.  Some exist only as documentation of lessons learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        The common thread is that they were built to solve a real problem, not to chase novelty.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Legacy</h2>
      <p>
        I am in possession of writings and records created by those who came before me,
        including my great grandfather.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are not artifacts to be optimized or summarized.  They are preserved as they were written,
        with context added only where it helps understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        This section exists to keep those voices from disappearing and to remind me that
        the work we do today eventually becomes someone else’s history.
      </p>
    </section>


    <section>
      <h2>Letters and Recordings</h2>
      <p>
        Some thoughts are better spoken than written.
      </p>
      <p>
        This space will hold short recordings.  Reflections, explanations, stories, and lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are not performances.  They are messages intended to be understood later,
        possibly by someone who is not yet old enough to care.
      </p>
    </section>


    <footer>
      <p>
        SchmidtWorx exists to build, preserve, and pass forward what matters.
