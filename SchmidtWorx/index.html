      <h2>What This Is</h2>

      <p>
        SchmidtWorx is a personal workspace.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of what lives here reflects the present.<br />
        Some belongs to those who came before me.<br />
        Some is meant for those who will come after.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>All of it is intentional.</strong>
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="reflections">
      <h2>Reflections</h2>

      <p>
        Making sense of the present.<br />
        Before it cures into hindsight.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="legacy">
      <h2>Legacy</h2>

      <p>
        Writings and records created by those who came before me.
      </p>

      <p>
        These are preserved as they were written, with context added only where it aids understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        This section exists to keep those voices from disappearing
        and to acknowledge that today’s work eventually becomes someone else’s history.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="letters">
      <h2>Letters and Recordings</h2>

      <p>
        Addressed forward, not written for the moment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <footer>
      <p>
        SchmidtWorx exists to understand, preserve,
        and pass forward what matters.
