  <h2>The Gift of a Letter</h2>

  <p><em>(Taken from an article written by W. H. Parachin)</em></p>

  <p>
    When Ronald Reagan was president, he received a painful letter
    from a young woman in Georgia. She described a time she had
    been married to a Vietnam veteran who suffered terribly from
    flashbacks because of the war. Although he tried to get help
    by seeing a succession of counselors and therapists, he could
    not find a way to exorcise the demons that raged within.
  </p>

  <p>
    Eventually, her husband committed suicide.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ronald Reagan’s immediate reply was memorable and stirring.
    He wrote, “I am truly sorry for the tragedy you have described.
    I realize you feel you’ve lost everything that conflict cost you.
    You mention having difficulty with bitterness and anger.
    Those are such common reactions to suffering.
    I hope you can find some comfort in knowing that your grief
    and anger are understandable.”
  </p>

  <p>
    This letter, with its sensitivity and empathy, gave the woman
    a sense that her pain was acknowledged and understood.
    It did not offer quick answers or easy solutions.
    Instead, it conveyed compassion.
  </p>

  <p>
    A letter can be a gift.
  </p>

  <p>
    A letter can offer encouragement.
    A letter can say what might be too difficult to speak aloud.
    A letter can affirm.
    A letter can comfort.
  </p>

  <p>
    Long after the spoken word is forgotten,
    a letter can be read again and again.

  <h2>Rules of Life</h2>

  <p><em>Authors Unknown</em></p>

  <p><em>(Different quotes Grandpa often sent in letters)</em></p>

  <p>
    Yesterday is history.<br />
    Tomorrow is a mystery.<br />
    Today is a gift.<br />
    That is why it is called the present.
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God to take away my pain.<br />
    God said, “No. It is not for me to take away,
    but for you to give it up.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God to make my handicapped child whole.<br />
    God said, “No. His spirit is whole.
    His body is only temporary.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God to grant me patience.<br />
    God said, “No. Patience is a byproduct of tribulations.
    It isn’t granted; it is earned.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God to give me happiness.<br />
    God said, “No. I give blessings.
    Happiness is up to you.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God to spare me pain.<br />
    God said, “No. Suffering draws you apart from worldly cares
    and brings you closer to me.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God to make my spirit grow.<br />
    God said, “No. You must grow on your own,
    but I will prune you to make you fruitful.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God for all things that I might enjoy life.<br />
    God said, “No. I will give you life,
    so that you may enjoy all things.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked God to help me love others as much as he loves me.<br />
    God said, “Ahhhh… finally you have the idea.”

  <h2>Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow</h2>

  <p>
    There are two days in every week that we should not worry about,
    two days that should be kept free from fear and apprehension.
  </p>

  <p>
    One of these days is Yesterday.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yesterday, with its cares and burdens,
    its faults and mistakes,
    its pains and aches.
  </p>

  <p>
    Yesterday has passed forever beyond our control.
    All the money in the world cannot bring yesterday back.
    We cannot undo a single act or erase a single word we said.
    Yesterday is gone.
  </p>

    <p>
    The other day we should not worry about is Tomorrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tomorrow, with its possible adversities,
    its burdens,
    its large promise and poor performance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Tomorrow is beyond our immediate control.
    Tomorrow’s sun will rise,
    either in splendor or behind a mask of clouds.
  </p>

  <p>
    But whether it rises in splendor or behind clouds,
    we cannot control tomorrow.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead, let us live one day at a time.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only day we have control over is Today.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today, with its opportunities and responsibilities,
    its chances and its choices.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today is the day to work,
    today is the day to love,
    today is the day to live.
  </p>

  <p>
    Today is the day we can influence,
    shape,
    and make meaningful.
  </p>

  <p>
    So let us not worry about Yesterday,
    for it is gone.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us not worry about Tomorrow,
    for it is not yet here.
  </p>

  <p>
    Let us live for Today.

  <h2>Heaven’s Grocery Store</h2>

  <p>
    I was walking down life’s highway a long time ago.
    One day I saw a sign that read,
    “Heaven’s Grocery Store.”
  </p>

  <p>
    As I got a little closer,
    the door came open wide,
    and when I came to myself,
    I was standing inside.
  </p>

  <p>
    I saw a host of angels.
    They were standing everywhere.
    One handed me a basket
    and said, “My child, shop with care.”
  </p>

  <p>
    Everything a Christian needed
    was in that grocery store,
    and all you couldn’t carry
    you could come back for more.
  </p>

  <p>
    First I got some patience.
    Love was in the same row.
    Further down was understanding,
    you need that everywhere you go.
  </p>

  <p>
    I got a box of wisdom,
    a bag or two of faith.
    I couldn’t miss the Holy Spirit,
    for He was all over the place.
  </p>

  <p>
    I stopped to get some strength and courage
    to help me run the race.
    My basket was getting full,
    but I remembered I still needed grace.
  </p>

  <p>
    I didn’t forget salvation,
    for salvation was free.
    I tried to get enough of that
    to save both you and me.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I started to the counter
    to pay my grocery bill.
    I thought everything I had
    would surely cost me dear.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I got up to the counter,
    I saw a sign that said,
    “All things are free.”
  </p>

  <p>
    I smiled and said, “Thank you,”
    and left the store with joy.
    I knew I had been blessed
    in a way I could not destroy.

  <h2>True Prayer</h2>

  <p>
    I asked God to give me strength,
    that I might achieve.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was made weak,
    that I might learn humbly to obey.
  </p>

  <p>
    I asked for health,
    that I might do greater things.
  </p>

  <p>
    I was given infirmity,
    that I might do better things.

    Some are listed by title, others include remembered verses as they were written.

  <p>
    This transcription reflects the original document as closely as possible.
    Minor wording differences may exist.
  </p>

  <p>
    Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound,
    that saved a wretch like me.
    I once was lost, but now am found,
    was blind, but now I see.
  </p>

  <p>
    Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
    Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
    Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
    born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.
  </p>

  <p>
    What a friend we have in Jesus,
    all our sins and griefs to bear.
    What a privilege to carry
    everything to God in prayer.
  </p>

  <p>
    Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
    let me hide myself in Thee.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the garden I come to Thee,
    while the dew is still on the roses.
    And the voice I hear falling on my ear,
    the Son of God discloses.
  </p>

  <p>
    How great Thou art, how great Thou art.
  </p>

  <p>
    These songs were sung in homes, churches, and gatherings,
    and carried forward through memory as much as melody.

  <h2>A Little Family History</h2>

  <p>
    This section records family history as it was remembered and written,
    reflecting personal recollection rather than formal genealogy.
  </p>

  <p>
    This transcription is best-effort and may contain minor wording differences

  </p>

  <p>
    The Schmidt family roots reach back through earlier generations,
    shaped by hard work, faith, and perseverance.
  </p>

  <p>
    Family members worked the land, raised livestock,
    and built homes with their own hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    Life was not easy, but necessities were provided through effort,
    cooperation, and responsibility.
  </p>

  <p>
    Education was valued, even when opportunities were limited.
  </p>

  <p>
    Children were taught the importance of honesty,
    respect for others, and commitment to family.
  </p>

  <p>
    Faith played an important role in daily life,
    guiding decisions and providing strength in difficult times.
  </p>

  <p>
    The family endured periods of hardship,
    including economic uncertainty and times of loss.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through these challenges, family bonds remained strong.

  <p>
    Traditions were passed down through stories,

  <h2>A Letter to All the Great Grandchildren</h2>

  <p>
    This letter was written with the future in mind,
    addressed to generations not yet grown.
  </p>

  <p>
    This transcription is best-effort and may contain minor wording differences
    from the original document.
  </p>

  <p>
    Dear Great Grandchildren,
  </p>

  <p>
    I am writing this letter to you because I want you to know something
    about your family and where you came from.
  </p>

  <p>
    You may be living in a very different time than I did,
    with new inventions, new ways of doing things,
    and new challenges to face.
  </p>

  <p>
    No matter how much the world changes,
    some things never change.
  </p>

  <p>
    Work hard at whatever you do.
    Do not expect something for nothing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Be honest in your dealings with others.
    Your name and reputation are worth more than money.
  </p>

  <p>
    Treat people fairly and with respect,
    no matter who they are or where they come from.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take care of your family.
    Family is one of the greatest blessings you will ever have.
  </p>

  <p>
    Help others whenever you can.
    You never know how much a small kindness may mean.
  </p>

  <p>
    Learn to accept responsibility for your actions.
    Mistakes will happen, but what matters is how you respond to them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Do not be afraid of hard times.
    Difficult experiences can teach you the most important lessons.
  </p>

  <p>
    Be thankful for what you have.
    Gratitude will carry you through both good times and bad.
  </p>

  <p>
    Remember those who came before you.
    Their work and sacrifices helped make your life possible.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you remember these things,
    you will be able to face life with confidence and purpose.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope that when you read this,
    you will know that you were loved and thought of long before you were born.
  </p>

  <p>
    With love,
  </p>

  <p>
    Your Great Grandfather
