    <summary>On Delayed Conflict</summary>

    <p>
      I learned something uncomfortable about myself later than I should have.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am not spontaneous in conflict.
      What looks sudden is usually long prepared.
    </p>

    <p>
      From the beginning of most relationships, I notice the things that bother me.
      Some of them are small.
      Some of them are not.
      I notice patterns, habits, misalignments.
      I rarely forget them.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time, I tell myself I am being patient.
      That I am choosing restraint.
      That I am letting things go.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I am not letting them go.
    </p>

    <p>
      It came from months or years of unexpressed frustration, carefully shaped in private.
      The words are chosen to land.
      The timing is chosen to end things.
      The impact is rarely accidental.
    </p>

    <p>
      I used to mistake this for strength.
      For discipline.
      For strategic restraint.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is none of those things.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is conflict avoidance disguised as control.
      It is resentment mistaken for patience.
      It is emotional debt allowed to accrue interest until it can no longer be paid cleanly.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cost is always higher at collection than it would have been at disclosure.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am learning that saying something early is not the same as escalating.
      That clarity is not cruelty.
      That silence does not make me generous, only unreadable.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is not a trait I am proud of.
      It is a pattern I am responsible for.
    </p>

    <p>
      If this record exists for any reason, it is to mark the difference between noticing a behavior and defending it.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work is not in sharpening the blade.
      The work is in never needing to use it.
