    <p>
      This page collects personal reflections written at different points in life,
      usually in response to experience rather than with a specific outcome in mind.

    <p>
      These writings are not meant to instruct or persuade.
      They simply capture how certain things were thought through at the time.

      <summary>On Delayed Conflict</summary>

      <p>
        I learned something uncomfortable about myself later than I should have.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am not spontaneous in conflict.
        What looks sudden is usually long prepared.
      </p>

      <p>
        From the beginning of most relationships, I notice the things that bother me.
        Some of them are small.
        Some of them are not.
        I notice patterns, habits, misalignments.
        I rarely forget them.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the time, I tell myself I am being patient.
        That I am choosing restraint.
        That I am letting things go.
      </p>

      <p>
        But I am not letting them go.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am deferring them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each time I decide not to say something, I log it internally.
        Not as a note, but as a credit.
        A favor given.
        A concession made.
        An imbalance created.
      </p>

      <p>
        The other person never knows this transaction occurred.
        That does not stop me from counting it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Over time, those unspoken moments accumulate.
        What could have been addressed cleanly becomes heavier.
        The feeling compounds.
        The narrative sharpens.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time I finally speak, I am no longer responding to the original issue.
        I am responding to everything it grew into while I stayed silent.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the most dangerous part of the pattern.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I eventually confront someone, it can feel disproportionate.
        Sudden.
        Overwhelming.
        As if the response came from nowhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        It did not.
      </p>

      <p>
        It came from months or years of unexpressed frustration, carefully shaped in private.
        The words are chosen to land.
        The timing is chosen to end things.
        The impact is rarely accidental.
      </p>

      <p>
        I used to mistake this for strength.
        For discipline.
        For strategic restraint.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is none of those things.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is conflict avoidance disguised as control.
        It is resentment mistaken for patience.
        It is emotional debt allowed to accrue interest until it can no longer be paid cleanly.
      </p>

      <p>
        The cost is always higher at collection than it would have been at disclosure.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am learning that saying something early is not the same as escalating.
        That clarity is not cruelty.
        That silence does not make me generous, only unreadable.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is not a trait I am proud of.
        It is a pattern I am responsible for.
      </p>

      <p>
        If this record exists for any reason, it is to mark the difference between noticing a behavior and defending it.
      </p>

      <p>
        The work is not in sharpening the blade.
        The work is in never needing to use it.
