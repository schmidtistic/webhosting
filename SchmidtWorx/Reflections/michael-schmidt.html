      <h2>Context</h2>

      <p>
        This page collects personal reflections written at different points in life,
        often in response to experience rather than with any specific outcome intended.
      </p>

      <p>
        These writings are not meant to instruct or persuade.
        They simply capture how certain things were thought through at the time.
      </p>
