  <h2>Context</h2>
  <p>
    This page collects written reflections produced over time.
    They were written to understand something, not to persuade anyone else.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each piece stands on its own.
    Ordering implies relationship, not chronology.

            <!-- FULL CONTENT UNCHANGED -->
            <p>I learned something uncomfortable about myself later than I should have.</p>
            <p>I am not spontaneous in conflict. What looks sudden is usually long prepared.</p>
            <p>From the beginning of most relationships, I notice the things that bother me.</p>
            <p>Some of them are small. Some of them are not.</p>
            <p>I notice patterns, habits, misalignments. I rarely forget them.</p>
            <p>At the time, I tell myself I am being patient.</p>
            <p>That I am choosing restraint. That I am letting things go.</p>
            <p>But I am not letting them go.</p>
            <p>It came from months or years of unexpressed frustration, carefully shaped in private.</p>
            <p>The words are chosen to land. The timing is chosen to end things.</p>
            <p>The impact is rarely accidental.</p>
            <p>I used to mistake this for strength. For discipline. For strategic restraint.</p>
            <p>It is none of those things.</p>
            <p>It is conflict avoidance disguised as control.</p>
            <p>It is resentment mistaken for patience.</p>
            <p>It is emotional debt allowed to accrue interest.</p>
            <p>The cost is always higher at collection than it would have been at disclosure.</p>
            <p>I am learning that saying something early is not escalation.</p>
            <p>That clarity is not cruelty.</p>
            <p>That silence does not make me generous.</p>
            <p>This is not a trait I am proud of.</p>
            <p>It is a pattern I am responsible for.</p>
            <p>The work is not in sharpening the blade.</p>
            <p>The work is in never needing to use it.</p>

            <summary>On the Simulation Trap</summary>
            <!-- FULL CONTENT UNCHANGED -->
            <p>I have a habit of resolving conflicts before they happen.</p>
            <p>Not by addressing them, but by running them to completion in my head.</p>
            <p>When something feels off, I don’t ask questions immediately.</p>
            <p>I simulate.</p>
            <p>I imagine what you might say.</p>
            <p>I imagine how I would respond.</p>
            <p>I imagine how that response would be received.</p>
            <p>Then I branch.</p>
            <p>I run the polite version.</p>
            <p>The honest version.</p>
            <p>The surgical version.</p>
            <p>The version that ends things.</p>
            <p>By the time I’m done, the conversation feels finished.</p>
            <p>This gives me a sense of control.</p>
            <p>It feels efficient.</p>
            <p>It is neither.</p>
            <p>The simulation starts to feel real.</p>
            <p>I become angry at things that were never said.</p>
            <p>I become defensive against reactions that never occurred.</p>
            <p>This is the trap.</p>
            <p>The goal is not to simulate better.</p>
            <p>The goal is to stop substituting simulation for contact.</p>
