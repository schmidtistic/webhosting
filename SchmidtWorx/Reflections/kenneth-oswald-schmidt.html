            <p><em>(Taken from an article written by W. H. Parachin)</em></p>

            <p>
              When Ronald Reagan was president, he received a painful letter
              from a young woman in Georgia.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually, her husband committed suicide.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ronald Reagan’s reply conveyed compassion and understanding.
            </p>

              A letter can be a gift.
