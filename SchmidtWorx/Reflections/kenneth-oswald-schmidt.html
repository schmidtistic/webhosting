            <summary>The Gift of a Letter</summary>

            <p><em>(Taken from an article written by W. H. Parachin)</em></p>

            <p>
              When Ronald Reagan was president, he received a painful letter
              from a young woman in Georgia.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually, her husband committed suicide.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ronald Reagan’s reply conveyed compassion and understanding.

            <summary>A Little Family History</summary>
            <center><u>Written March 1995</u></center>
            <p>I have never recorded much about older Schmidts because I didn't know a lot about them.  But am putting down what I do recall. 
            </p>
            <p>
              At one time I had a list of our heritage, but it got away from me.  I do know there was a connection with English Royalty and a Schmidt was a school master in England and he wrote a school book that was used by the schools there.
            </p>
            <p>Of my fathers family, they must have lived about 1850 in Kittery, Main and lived there into the mid 1900's.  I never knew anything about my grandfather on my dad's side, but his widow, my grandmother, was in an accident with a run away horse and was an invalid the rest of her life.  I recall that she corresponded with my mother a number of years in the early 1900's.  After she died, I had a couple of letters from a man named Dudley.</p>
            <p>My grandparents had eight children that grew to adulthood - seven girls and one boy who was the last, and was my father</p>
            <p>The oldest girl was Adelaid Elizabeth; she finished college with honors and an angel sponsored her for a year in England studying music.</p>
            <p>Adelaid was wooed and married to an engineer from Texas by the name of Wayland.  They moved to Washinton, Kansas in the 1800's where he built bridges and made a small fortune.  He built a huge home there.  Eventually he was put in a mental institution where he died</p>
            <p>I was born October 4, 1905 in a house across the street from their house.  The Waylands had two daughters, Beatrice and Ethel.</p>
            <p>Beatrice married a bank clerk in Wathena, Kansas and lived most of her life around St. Joseph, Missouri.  She had two children, a girl and a boy.</p>
            <p>Ethel married an oil man from Enid, Oklahoma, where she spent most of the rest of her life.  They had one daughter.</p>
            <p>Eventually after retirement, Adelaid and both her daughters ended up in Sarasota, Florida.</p>
            <p>I was intimately acquainted with Adelaid or (Aunt Nell as she was known) and I lived with her for a time while attending school in that big house of which I previously recorded.  I corresponded with all three, all their lives, into the middle of the 1900's.</p>

            <summary>A Letter to All the Great Grandchildren</summary>

            <p>
              Did you know that your great, great, great grandfather was gored to death by a bull?  He was my grandfather on my mother's side.
            </p>
            <p>His name was Mathias Oswald.  His parents came over from Hanover, Germany and they settled for a short time in Pennsylvania, then with friends and relatives they came to Kansas and helped establish the town of Hanover, Kansas.</p>
            <p>Mathias was married twice, and had a large family of children with several of them dying in infancy.  Seven grew up and are listed in the Schmidt "family tree."</p>
            <p>Mathias homesteaded a farm four miles south of Hanover, Kansas on the Little Blue river.  The half of the farm next to the river had to be cleared of many trees before they could farm it.  The other half was hilly ground and they called it pasture land.</p>
            <p>He was a farmer and also a cattle buyer, raiser and feeder.  Cattle were usually grass fed for several years.  they were then shut up in feed lots and stuffed with corn to make them fat so that when they took them to the slaughter houses, they would bring more money</p>
            <p>It was told that at some time in his life he had driven a freight wagon from Omaha, Nebrasks to Abeline, Kansas.  There were noroads, only trails.  Indians and buffalor still romaed the plains.  There were no bridges, so the freight wagons had to find ways to cross the streams and rivers, and of course they were in all kinds of bad weather for weeks at a time</p>
            <p>My mother told me that bands of Indians would come to their home and be allowed to come into the house.  They would try to trade anything they had (which wasn't much) for anything they liked, even food that was on the table.  they wer4e friendly Indians and they tried to treat them nice, but they were a little afraid of them as there were so many bad stories told about them</p>
            <p>Another story was that a roving band of Indians had found a dead horse that had been thrown in a ditch and they cooked and ate it and partied late into the night</p>
            <p>The Oswalds were very influential and populare and are recorded in the Washington County Centennial of the early history of the county</p>
            <p>The original Oswalds home was a small white stone house made from stone from the hill side.  It was remodeled, but is now much the same as I can remember seventy or more years ago</p>
            <p>As the buffalo were being killed off, cattle were introduced and raised.  Cows could be turned loose on open range and they would have calves and they would grow and they themselves have calves with practically no care or attention.  Cattle were branded with a hot iron with an insignia of the owner.  Every year they would be "rounded up", the new calves branded, and some of the stock sold to the slaughter houses.  Cattle raising is still a big industry in the U.S. today.</p>
            <p>The Oswald homsetead had a large feed lot and they "fed out" a lot of cattle year after year.  As you know "I hope" a bull is necessary to a herd of cattle and some of these critters were notoriously cranky and would try to protect their herd from any intrusion.  It has long been said that anything red would make them mad if waved in front of them.  I can recall crossing many pastures with cattle in them, but was always on the alert for any bad bull in the herd.</p>
            <p>On one particular day, my grandfather had occasion to go in the feed lot alone, and when they heard him call they came and chased the bull away but he had got him down and stomped on him.  He died shortly afterward</p>
            <p>They said it was the largest funeral in Washington County and the parade of wagons, buggies, horse back and people walking was over four miles long from the home to the cemetary in hanover.  He was considered a fairly rich man for that time and owned several sections of land in Western Kansas, although land in those days could be bought very cheap.  His estate was estimated at eightly thousand dollars, but as I said he had many children so the shares were quite small.  My mother took a half section of land as her share.</p>
            <p>He was an outstanding man and I'm sure they still have records of him in Hanover, Kansas.</p>

            <summary>Growing Up with Nellie</summary>
            <p>Nellie Florence Bowland Schmidt was born in Tiffin, Ohio and moved to Kansas when she was four years old.  Her parents were share croppers on a farm five miles northwest of Washington, Kansas called the "Hatch" neighborhood from the country school so maned there.</p>
            <p>Nelli attended this school thru the eight grade and mostly walked the mile and a half morning and night in all kinds of weather.  The closest neighbors were nearly a mile away.</p>
            <p>In hger younger years the common way to get around aside from walking, was the use a horse.  The roads were dirt with the better ones graded and ditched a little.  they were very muddy when it rained and very hot and dusty in the summer time.  When the hills were too steep, the road just went around them.  The bridges were mostly wooden structures that frequently washed out in the spring storms</p>
            <p>The farm was a quarter section and divided into corn and wheat fields and some pasture.  Farming was very unpredictable and storms and bugs and dry or wet weather would often ruin crops year after year.  A garden and orchard provided much of the food they had to eat.  Canning and drying helped tide them over the winter.</p>
            <p>They had a few horses, cows, pigs, and also some chickens.  Money was scarce and there were few luxuries.  Farming was hard work.  There were many chores that made the hours long.</p>
            <p>With very few visitors there were many lonely days and nights.  The few holidays were anticipated and planned long in advance.  The school provided much of the entertainment of the community.  Later the telephone helped to dispel the lonliness.</p>
            <p>A trip to town was a treat and at times would not be made for months at a time.  When cream and eggs gained a commercial value, the trips became weekly and the farmers rigs would line up for blocks around the business section of every town.  usually several creameries vied for the trade and "the cream and egg", money was the only money some of the farmers saw for long periods of time.</p>
            <p>Grocery stores had very few canned goods, most items were sold in the bulk.  There were lots of smells including kerosene which everone needed for their lamps and lanterns</p>
            <p>It is hard to imagine now what a terrible pest the housefly was.  There were billions of them and they got into everything.  They were filthy and went from barn and manure piles to hog pens to toilets and into homes.  The horses and cattle had to fight them constantly.  Screened doors were often completely covered and they swarmed inside every time the door was opened.  Fly swatters and fly traps didn't make a dent in them</p>
            <p>Rats and mice were very destructive pests and they managed to get into everything.  Their burroughs sometimes under mined homes and barns.  Traps and poisons did not phase them.</p>
            <p>There were few doctors, but they did make house calls.  they serviced quite large areas and either walked or used a horse for transportation.  They were called mostly in emergencies and tended everyone impartially.  There were many contagious diseases and few vaccines or medicines.</p>
            <p>Nellie's first doll was made by mother from scraps of cloth and the face was just panted on, but she was thrilled with it and loved it for many years.</p>
            <p>At her early Christmas there were no presents, just candies and maybe an orange or an apple.</p>
            <p>Women and girls never cut their hair and it grew long.  they spent lots of time combine and braiding it and coiled it in many shapes held with many hair pins.</p>
            <p>Most of the women and girls wore hats and even then it was popular to get a new hat for Easter.  the Millinery stores were wonderful to behold with hats of all shapes and decorated with cloth and ribbons and beads and feathers.  Very seldom were any two made alike.</p>
            <p>Girls as well as boys wore long underwear called "union suits", in the winter.  The first of April got to be celebrated as the day you could take off your longies.  Nellie confesses that she sometimes rolled the legs up past her knees when dhe didn't think her mom would find out.</p>
            <p>Now many years later, many of these scenes now come vividly back to mind and the loves and hates and thrills and sorrows are still felt as strongly as they were then.</p>

            <summary>Frank Bessler The Rich Relative</summary>
            <p>Frank Bessler spent most of his adult life around Akron, Ohio.  After he married Carrie Bowland (Nellie's older sister), he managed to make a living as a carpenter.  He tried a number of things and had several inventions.  He invented the first disappearing stairway and had a factory known as the Bessler Stairway Company for many years in Akron.  He made a small fortune.</p>
            <p>He was a Catholic and Carrie joined the church when they married.  They stronlgy supported the church all their life.  they never had any children.  He built a beautiful home on Portage Lake south of Akron.  at one time he owned about ten houses on the lake.</p>
            <p>[Note from Marge] - When Aunt Carrie and Uncle Frank came to visit, all the neighborhood kids managed to come around because he would take a big roll of bills out of his pocket and give all the kids a dollar</p>
            <p>He left his estate in trust in favor of the church but Carrie was permitted to the company profits the rest of her life.  Carrie ran the company for a number of years and left a sizeable estate to her relatives when she died.  The factory and real estate was held in trust in the hands of the lawyer who drew up the wills.</p>
            <p>[Note from Marge] - As I remember the story, she left about $20,000 to each of her sisters and her brother.  The rest was supposed to go to the Catholic church.  The lawyer, however, got her to break the trust and sell the company, and in the end, he ended up with the bulk of the estate including the homes on the lake.) Some family members and some people from the Catholic church tried to contest it but to no avail</p>
            <p>Frank couldn't read or write very well and his secretary recorded intimate experiences in a little notebook</p>
            <p>When Carrie died I read some of those notes and he said that on several occasions he had been transported in his sleep to a heavenly areas where he met Christ and other biblical characters and that he saw and talked to a dog with a man's head.</p>
            <p>[Note from Marge] - I winder what he was smoking</p>
            <p>Carrie Bessler has been dead many years now and it has just dawned on me that many blessings have graced me and my family since knowing these people.</p>

            <summary>Little Boy Lost</summary>
            <p>This is a story they will tell about me.  I was just a toddler.  We lived in Washington, Kansas near the railroad tracks.  I had wandered away one day and came to a man selling apples out of a boxcar.  I guess he gave me an apple and I wouldn't leave.  It was getting late and he wanted to leave and he didn't want to leave me alone, so he took me by the hand and house after house he tried to get me to go in.  He finally came to our house and I went right in.  My mother cam eout to thank him and it was her older brother who lived in a neighboring town and had come just to sell the apples.</p>

            <summary>Growing Up</summary>
            <p>I used to like to hunt, fish, trap and just sxplore, when I was young and had enough free reign to become intimately acquainted with the creeks, the woods, and the fields for miles around.</p>
            <p>The only way we had to get somewhere was to ride "shank horses", (that means to walk) and I wore out many a pair of shoes, which were very hard to come by</p>
            <p>I recall hunting one day miles from home and walking quietly up a small gully and coming face to face with some animal in a bush just a few feet away.  I just looked at it and it looked at me for what seemed like a full minute.  I first thought it might be a baby sheep but decided it must be a jack rabbit, so I shot and killed it.  It was a big one.  I cut a small slit on his leg where there is a strong tendon and strung him on my belt.  It was pretty good sized and his head drug on the ground.  He was heavy and by the time I got him home, I was tuckered out.</p>
            <p>Jack rabbit meat tastes a little wild and strong, but we ground it up and mom mixed it with hamburger and sausage, and it was real good.</p>
            <p>They are nearly all gone now.  The last ones I ever saw were on a prarie in western Texas.</p>
