            <p><em>(Taken from an article written by W. H. Parachin)</em></p>

            <p>
              When Ronald Reagan was president, he received a painful letter
              from a young woman in Georgia.
            </p>

            <p>
              Eventually, her husband committed suicide.
            </p>

            <p>
              Ronald Reagan’s reply conveyed compassion and understanding.

              A letter can be a gift.

            <summary>A Little Family History</summary>
            <center><u>Written March 1995</u></center>
            <p>I have never recorded much about older Schmidts because I didn't know a lot about them.  But am putting down what I do recall. 
            </p>
            <p>
              At one time I had a list of our heritage, but it got away from me.  I do know there was a connection with English Royalty and a Schmidt was a school master in England and he wrote a school book that was used by the schools there.
            </p>
            <p>Of my fathers family, they must have lived about 1850 in Kittery, Main and lived there into the mid 1900's.  I never knew anything about my grandfather on my dad's side, but his widow, my grandmother, was in an accident with a run away horse and was an invalid the rest of her life.  I recall that she corresponded with my mother a number of years in the early 1900's.  After she died, I had a couple of letters from a man named Dudley.</p>
            <p>My grandparents had eight children that grew to adulthood - seven girls and one boy who was the last, and was my father</p>
            <p>The oldest girl was Adelaid Elizabeth; she finished college with honors and an angel sponsored her for a year in England studying music.</p>
            <p>Adelaid was wooed and married to an engineer from Texas by the name of Wayland.  They moved to Washinton, Kansas in the 1800's where he built bridges and made a small fortune.  He built a huge home there.  Eventually he was put in a mental institution where he died</p>
            <p>I was born October 4, 1905 in a house across the street from their house.  The Waylands had two daughters, Beatrice and Ethel.</p>
            <p>Beatrice married a bank clerk in Wathena, Kansas and lived most of her life around St. Joseph, Missouri.  She had two children, a girl and a boy.</p>
            <p>Ethel married an oil man from Enid, Oklahoma, where she spent most of the rest of her life.  They had one daughter.</p>
            <p>Eventually after retirement, Adelaid and both her daughters ended up in Sarasota, Florida.</p>
            <p>I was intimately acquainted with Adelaid or (Aunt Nell as she was known) and I lived with her for a time while attending school in that big house of which I previously recorded.  I corresponded with all three, all their lives, into the middle of the 1900's.</p>

            <summary>A Letter to All the Great Grandchildren</summary>

            <p>
              Did you know that your great, great, great grandfather was gored to death by a bull?  He was my grandfather on my mother's side.
            </p>
            <p>His name was Mathias Oswald.  His parents came over from Hanover, Germany and they settled for a short time in Pennsylvania, then with friends and relatives they came to Kansas and helped establish the town of Hanover, Kansas.</p>
            <p>Mathias was married twice, and had a large family of children with several of them dying in infancy.  Seven grew up and are listed in the Schmidt "family tree."</p>
            <p>Mathias homesteaded a farm four miles south of Hanover, Kansas on the Little Blue river.  The half of the farm next to the river had to be cleared of many trees before they could farm it.  The other half was hilly ground and they called it pasture land.</p>
            <p>He was a farmer and also a cattle buyer, raiser and feeder.  Cattle were usually grass fed for several years.  they were then shut up in feed lots and stuffed with corn to make them fat so that when they took them to the slaughter houses, they would bring more money</p>
            <p>It was told that at some time in his life he had driven a freight wagon from Omaha, Nebrasks to Abeline, Kansas.  There were noroads, only trails.  Indians and buffalor still romaed the plains.  There were no bridges, so the freight wagons had to find ways to cross the streams and rivers, and of course they were in all kinds of bad weather for weeks at a time</p>
            <p>My mother told me that bands of Indians would come to their home and be allowed to come into the house.  They would try to trade anything they had (which wasn't much) for anything they liked, even food that was on the table.  they wer4e friendly Indians and they tried to treat them nice, but they were a little afraid of them as there were so many bad stories told about them</p>
            <p>Another story was that a roving band of Indians had found a dead horse that had been thrown in a ditch and they cooked and ate it and partied late into the night</p>
            <p>The Oswalds were very influential and populare and are recorded in the Washington County Centennial of the early history of the county</p>
            <p>The original Oswalds home was a small white stone house made from stone from the hill side.  It was remodeled, but is now much the same as I can remember seventy or more years ago</p>
            <p>As the buffalo were being killed off, cattle were introduced and raised.  Cows could be turned loose on open range and they would have calves and they would grow and they themselves have calves with practically no care or attention.  Cattle were branded with a hot iron with an insignia of the owner.  Every year they would be "rounded up", the new calves branded, and some of the stock sold to the slaughter houses.  Cattle raising is still a big industry in the U.S. today.</p>
            <p>The Oswald homsetead had a large feed lot and they "fed out" a lot of cattle year after year.  As you know "I hope" a bull is necessary to a herd of cattle and some of these critters were notoriously cranky and would try to protect their herd from any intrusion.  It has long been said that anything red would make them mad if waved in front of them.  I can recall crossing many pastures with cattle in them, but was always on the alert for any bad bull in the herd.</p>
            <p>On one particular day, my grandfather had occasion to go in the feed lot alone, and when they heard him call they came and chased the bull away but he had got him down and stomped on him.  He died shortly afterward</p>
            <p>They said it was the largest funeral in Washington County and the parade of wagons, buggies, horse back and people walking was over four miles long from the home to the cemetary in hanover.  He was considered a fairly rich man for that time and owned several sections of land in Western Kansas, although land in those days could be bought very cheap.  His estate was estimated at eightly thousand dollars, but as I said he had many children so the shares were quite small.  My mother took a half section of land as her share.</p>
            <p>He was an outstanding man and I'm sure they still have records of him in Hanover, Kansas.</p>
